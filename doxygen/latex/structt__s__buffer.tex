A buffer of characters used by printf to store and display characters while a string is still no aligned with t\+\_\+longword.  




{\ttfamily \#include $<$buffer.\+h$>$}



\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
A buffer of characters used by printf to store and display characters while a string is still no aligned with t\+\_\+longword. 

Implements naive flush tactic, where formatted strings are allocated and only then added to buffer, displayed and freed. This allows to more easily reuse libft functions but might change at a later date once a first working prototype has been created. 

The documentation for this struct was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
includes/\mbox{\hyperlink{buffer_8h}{buffer.\+h}}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
