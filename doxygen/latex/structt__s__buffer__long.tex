A buffer of longwords used by printf to store and display multiple bytes of information at once.

\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
A buffer of longwords used by printf to store and display multiple bytes of information at once. 

Buffer can contain up to \mbox{[}BUFFER\+\_\+\+SIZE\mbox{]} characters, with an extra longword to guarantee null-\/termination. Characters are considered one longword at a time, which depending on system architecture is at least 8 bytes, with 16 bytes on 64-\/bit C implementations. Note that characters MUST be added one longword at a time and cannot be added seperatly. Because format strings in printf will not always be sizeof(t\+\_\+longword) bytes long, buffer may contain empty bytes where a format string has been added. Because of this, buffer will be considered as multiple null-\/terminated c strings upon display, until the end of the buffer has been reached.
